An admin can do everything that the normal user can do, and (tentatively): [Hieu]
- Host contest
- Modify contest
- Delete a contest

Aside from the above, an admin can also do these administrative actions:
- Change name of an organization.
- Delete anything (we can choose what we want to support due to limited time).
